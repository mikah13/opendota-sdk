/**
 * Manual type overrides for known schema inaccuracies.
 * These augment or replace types from the auto-generated schema
 * where the spec doesn't match reality.
 *
 * Each override should have a comment explaining WHY it exists
 * and linking to the relevant GitHub issue if applicable.
 */

// Example: If the schema types a field as `number` but it's always an integer,
// or if an array lacks item types, define the corrected type here.
// These get used in the resource modules via intersection or mapped types.
